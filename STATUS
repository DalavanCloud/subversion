Status of 1.10.1:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1829241
   * configure.ac   Fix variable name with path to rdoc, broken in r1806570.
   Justification:
     A regression in 1.10.0. Broke 'make install-swig-rb-doc'.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, stsp

 * r1829260
   Revert r1751167, since it broke use of pre-generated Swig bindings in
   release builds.
   Justification:
     Fix build of pre-generated Swig bindings when swig is not installed
   Votes:
     +1: jamessan, stsp

 * r1829344
   Make configure --without-lz4 or --without-utf8proc into explicit errors.
   Justification:
     LZ4 and UTF8PROC are not optional and configure should produce an error.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, stsp

 * r1830883,r1830900,r1830901
   Prune externals from excluded subtrees after 'update --set-depth=exclude'
   Justification:
     Current behaviour is inconsistent: Setting depth to 'empty' prunes
     externals while excluding a subtree does not.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1831110, 1831112
   Fix issue 4741: authz group cannot refer to multiple groups
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.9.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, stsp

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

* r1829012, r1829015
  Correctly claim to offer Gnome Keyring support with libsecret
  Justification:
    New feature, would cause confusion if missing from svn --version
  Votes:
    +1: astieger, brane, stsp

* r1828613
  Fix a JavaHL local refs capacity warning when unparsing externals.
  Justification:
    Prevents overflow of the JNI local references stack.
  Votes:
    +1: brane, stsp
