This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.11.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.11.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1840990, r1840991, r1840995, r1840997
   Various conflict resolver improvements.
   Notes:
     I am proposing these in a batch because merging them out of order would
     result in conflicts, and because I was planning to make these changes
     before 1.11 was branched in the first place but didn't get around to it.
     - r1840990 is a cosmetic output change
     - r1840991 prevents an out-of-bounds array access
     - r1840995 implements support for ambiguous moves in 'local missing' cases
     - r1840997 improves resolver API semantics
     Ideally, these should be merged before 1.11.0 is released.

 * r1841059
   Shelving: fix SVN-4774 "presence of old 1.10 shelves breaks shelf-list".
   Justification:
     A cleaner upgrade path for those testing experimental shelving. Changes
     the shelf storage dir to '.svn/x/shelves/v2'.

 * r1841091, r1841136
   Fix SVN-4776: Shelving: remove non-x-prefixed command aliases.
   Justification:
     Leaves the command-line UI clear for a future stable version.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, jamessan

 * r1841098
   Rename --viewspec to --x-viewspec.  See SVN-4776.
   Justification:
     Move experimental interfaces to a separate namespace.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, jamessan

 * r1841272
   'svn info --x-viewspec': Expose both output backends.
   Justification:
     Expose both output forms while the API is experimental to get better
     feedback.	(Or possibly just fall prey to the sunk cost fallacy.)
