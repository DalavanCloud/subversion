Status of 1.10.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1826720, r1826721, r1827191, r1827574
   Regression test and FSFS checksum test, part of issue 4722.
   Justification:
     Keeps 1.10 in sync with 1.11 and 1.9.
   Votes:
     +1: philip (without r1827574)
     +1: stefan2

 * r1826811, r1826814, r1826877, r1826907, r1826971
   Fix issue 4725: FSFS block-read mode doesn't work.
   Justification:
     Block-read is enabled automatically when svnadmin has a cache bigger
     than 64MB.  It can be manually enabled in mod_dav_svn/svnserve.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, stefan2

 * r1827562
   Shelving: fix encoding of non-ASCII shelf names.
   Justification:
     Allows using non-ASCII shelf names (in a non-ASCII locale).
   Notes:
     The file name differs between branch and trunk, so merge like this:
     svn merge -c1827562 ^/subversion/trunk/subversion/libsvn_client/shelf.c subversion/libsvn_client/shelve.c
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, stefan2

 * r1827337
   Shelving: Name the subcommands 'x-shelve' etc.
   Justification:
     Make users more aware of the 'experimental' nature.
   Branch:
     1.10.x-x-shelve
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1825979
   Minor clarification to docstring.
   Justification:
     Trivial documentation fix.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, jamessan
     -1: brane (the docstring "clarification" is wrong, since
                we do not propagate the compression level to LZ4)

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1827105, r1827114
   Add testsuite support for testing FSFS with block-read enabled.
   Justification:
     Allows testing the code responsible for issue 4725.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, julianfoad, stefan2
