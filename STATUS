Status of 1.10.3:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1839739
   Fix failing recently added tests when running with an older python
   Justification:
     Upgrading the sqlite inside python 2.7 is not easy on several platforms
     (including Windows). We shouldn't just fail the tests on this.
   Notes:
     This was a separate followup on changes that were already backported.
