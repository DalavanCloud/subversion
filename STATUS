This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.11.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.11.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1842814, r1842827, r1842829, r1842877
   Improve 'svn help' for the 'add' command and for the '-N' option.
   Justification:
     Proper documentation was lacking. Another newbie was recently surprised
     by how 'svn add' behaves relative to 'git add'.
   Notes:
     r1842814: Document the obsolete '-N' option properly.
     r1842827: Fully document 'svn add', and include some newbie tips.
     r1842829, r1842877: tweaks to formatting.

 * r1843888
   Fix issue #4768, repos-to-WC copy with --parents doesn't create directories.
   Justification:
     Consistency is good; repos-to-WC copy should behave like WC-to-WC copy.
   Votes:
     +1: brane, stsp

 * r1844882
   Fix propagation of mod_dav_svn's SVNUseUTF8 configuration setting.
   Justification:
     The option has no effect in some setups. User submitted the patch.

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1842334
   Update how we display the OS name on Mac in 'svn --version --verbose'.
   Justification:
     If we go to the trouble of displaying commercial OS names, we may as well
     do it right on macOS. Not critical for 1.11.0 but would be nice to have;
     the change has very minor impact.
