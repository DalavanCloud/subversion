Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1833621
   Since on Windows Subversion does not handle symlinks, never check for reparse points.
   Justification:
     Without this, shell extensions like TSVN fail with files in OneDrive on Windows.
   Votes:
     +1: steveking, stsp, jcorvel

 * r1830883,r1830900,r1830901
   Prune externals from excluded subtrees after 'update --set-depth=exclude'
   Justification:
     Current behaviour is inconsistent: Setting depth to 'empty' prunes
     externals while excluding a subtree does not.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, philip, jcorvel
     +0: rhuijben (in concept, not reviewed)

 * r1833836, r1833842
   Fix issue #4740, "conflict resolver searches too far back ..."
   Justification:
     The current behaviour is hard-coded to traverse all of history in
     a "local missing vs incoming edit" situation. This is impractical
     on repositories with a large number of revisions.
     Easy fix which just runs an already existing YCA search a bit
     earlier, falling back to full traversal if no YCA can be found.
     User complained and provided a reproduction script:
