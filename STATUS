 * r1847377
   Reduce the scope of the Windows-specific help text for 'svn list'.

   Votes:
     +1: brane, stefan2

 * r1847598, r1847697, r1847922, r1847924, r1847946
   Fix SVN-4793: authz rights from inverted access selectors were not
   accounted for at the global level, causing wrong authz check results.
   Justification:
     Fixes a regression in the new authz parser and resolver.
   Notes:
     - r1847598 and r1847697 are only test suite changes, but by including
       them we can avoids creating a backport branch.
     - r1847924 and r1847946 are tiny but IMO relevant comment tweaks.
   Votes:
     +1: brane, stefan2

 * r1850651
   Fix a use-after-free in mod_dav_svn's logging of FS warnings.
   Justification:
     Lots of crashes on OpenBSD during 'make check' with HTTPD 2.4.
