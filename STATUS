Status of 1.10.3:

Candidate changes:
==================

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1837790
   Make 'svnadmin verify --keep-going' always show an error summary. 
   Justification:
     Using --quiet made the --keep-going option much less useful.
     The whole point of --keep-going is to get a summary of errors.

 * r1838813, r1839703, r1839734, r1842262, r1842264
   Let 'svnadmin recover' prune the rep-cache even if it is disabled.
   Justification:
     Can potentially lead to data loss.

     +1: julianfoad, rhuijben
     +1: danielsh (would prefer read_rep_cache() to check format numbers; see the "r1838813" thread on dev@) (without r1839703, r1839734)

 * r1839662
   For 'local missing' conflicts, scan for moves only if a YCA is known.
   Justification:
     Prevents long-runing history scan which serves no useful purpose.

 * r1836960, r1836968
   Fix issue #4766, "resolver adds unrelated moves to move target list"
   Justification:
     Undesirable resolver behaviour: If an item was moved, all other items
     moved within the same revision will be considered viable merge targets.
   Notes:
     r1836960 adds a regression test
     r1836968 fixes the bug
