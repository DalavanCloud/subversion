Status of 1.10.1:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1833621
   Since on Windows Subversion does not handle symlinks, never check for reparse points.
   Justification:
     Without this, shell extensions like TSVN fail with files in OneDrive on Windows.
   Votes:
     +1: steveking, stsp

 * r1830883,r1830900,r1830901
   Prune externals from excluded subtrees after 'update --set-depth=exclude'
   Justification:
     Current behaviour is inconsistent: Setting depth to 'empty' prunes
     externals while excluding a subtree does not.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, philip
     +0: rhuijben (in concept, not reviewed)

 * r1830882
   Fix libsvn_auth_gnome_keyring.pc when built using libsecret.
   Justification:
     The generated .pc file references files libgnome-keyring, which
     is not used and may not exist.
   Votes:
     +1: jorton, stsp

 * r1833836, r1833842
   Fix issue #4740, "conflict resolver searches too far back ..."
   Justification:
     The current behaviour is hard-coded to traverse all of history in
     a "local missing vs incoming edit" situation. This is impractical
     on repositories with a large number of revisions.
     Easy fix which just runs an already existing YCA search a bit
     earlier, falling back to full traversal if no YCA can be found.
     User complained and provided a reproduction script:
     https://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2018-04/0060.shtml
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1830083, r1833864, r1833866
   Fix issue #4739, "Accept incoming deletion" option doing nothing
   for a locally deleted file
   Justification:
     Fixes undesirable conflict resolver behaviour.
   Notes:
     r1830083 adds a regression test
     r1833864 fixes the issue
     r1833866 is a small follow-up fix
