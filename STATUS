 * r1847572, r1847596
   fsfs: Fix SVN-4791, an issue with the DAG open_path() that was causing
   unexpected SVN_ERR_FS_NOT_DIRECTORY errors when attempting to open a path
   with `open_path_node_only | open_path_allow_null` flags.
   Justification:
     Some valid FSFS read operations errored out. This could break some
     end-user operations like 'update'.
