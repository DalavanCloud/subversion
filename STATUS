   Votes:
     +1: brane

 * r1847377
   Reduce the scope of the Windows-specific help text for 'svn list'.

     Should make backporting translations easier with a more more similar
     generated .po file.
   Votes:
     +1: brane, stefan2

 * r1847598, r1847697, r1847922, r1847924, r1847946
   Fix SVN-4793: authz rights from inverted access selectors were not
   accounted for at the global level, causing wrong authz check results.
   Justification:
     Fixes a regression in the new authz parser and resolver.
   Notes:
     - r1847598 and r1847697 are only test suite changes, but by including
       them we can avoids creating a backport branch.
     - r1847924 and r1847946 are tiny but IMO relevant comment tweaks.
   Votes:
     +1: brane, stefan2

 * r1850651
   Fix a use-after-free in mod_dav_svn's logging of FS warnings.
   Justification:
     Lots of crashes on OpenBSD during 'make check' with HTTPD 2.4.
     See https://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2018-12/0137.shtml
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, brane

 * r1851676, r1851687, r1851791
   Allow the use of empty groups in authz rules.
   Justification:
     Fixes regression from 1.9.x. Does not affect authz file semantics.
   Notes:
     - r1851676 adds a regression test.
     - r1851687 fixes the bug and extends the test.
     - r1851791 refers to issue #4802.

 * r1851903
   Fix missing unlock of working copy in a resolver error case.
   Justification:
     Could force users to run 'svn cleanup' unnecessarily.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1851920
   Remove a useless common ancestor search from the conflict resolver.
   Justification:
     Current behaviour is inefficient and could lead to dubious conflicts.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1852013
   Fix issue #4804: avoid test failures just because some SQLite compile-time
   feature was enabled that changes its query plan descriptions.
   Justification:
     Reported build failure on Gentoo Linux, see:
     https://bugs.gentoo.org/605438
   Votes:
     +1: brane

 * r1852436
   Make 'svn update' not record a tree conflict when deleting an unmodified
   directory which happens to contain unversioned items.
   Justification:
     Unnecessary tree conflict due to e.g. build artifacts on disk.
     User complained: https://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2019-01/0060.shtml
