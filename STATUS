Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1705038
   Fix issue #4607, patch with missing newline removes newline when applied.
   Justification:
     Silently makes unexpected changes.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     +0: rhuijben (while I agree that this patch fixes a problem, I don't
                   think this is the right backport. This patch changes the
                   behavior of a public api (with no known users except
                   libsvn_client) in a specific way for this issue. On trunk
                   this behavior change was reverted when a better fix was
                   implemented)

 * r1794166, r1795087
   Search for gpg-agent sockets in (/var)/run.
   Justification:
     Improves GPG socket detection when $GPG_AGENT_INFO is unset or when gpg
     >= 2.1.13 is used

   Votes:

     +1: philip

   Votes:
     +1: philip

   Let 'svnadmin recover' prune the rep-cache even if it is disabled.
   Justification:
     Can potentially lead to data loss.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad
     +0: danielsh (haven't reviewed the regression test)

 * r1843888
   Fix issue #4768, repos-to-WC copy with --parents doesn't create directories.
   Justification:

   Votes:
     +1: brane
