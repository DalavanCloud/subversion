This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.11.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.11.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1841079,r1841481,r1841567
   Move all experimental APIs to the private namespace.
   Justification:
     Unblock the 1.11 release
   Notes: r1841481 is the main change, renaming the symbols to include "__".
     r1841079 is included here to avoid merge conflicts: it removes older
     experimental APIs that were 'deprecated' but did not exist in 1.10.
     1841567 removes bogus '@since 1.X' annotations.

 * r1841716, r1841717
   Fix duplicate message IDs in Swedish (and future) translation files.
   Justification:
     Duplicate entries in .po files cause build failures.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1841059,r1841600,r1841601,r1841602,r1841606
   Change the shelf storage dir from ".svn/shelves" to
   ".svn/experimental/shelves/v2".
   Justification:
     Stop polluting the ".svn/" namespace with an experimental "shelves" subdir.
     Instead use a subdir intended for anything experimental/unstable.
     Also fixes SVN-4774 "presence of old 1.10 shelves breaks shelf-list",
     giving a cleaner upgrade path for those testing experimental shelving.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, jamessan
     +1: steveking

 * r1841180, r1841524, r1841525
   Merge the 'java10-compat' branch to trunk
   Justification:
     Enables building against Java 10 which is becoming the default JDK in
     many distributions
   Votes:
     +1: jcorvel, jamessan
     +1: danielsh (confirmed the buildsystem parts won't affect anything other
                   than the java bindings; this counts as three +1s for the
                   build system changes)
