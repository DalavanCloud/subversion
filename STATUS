   Votes:
     +1: philip, jamessan

 * r1834612, r1834835
   On the '1.10.x-issue4758' branch: Fix SVN-4758 "Unable to shelve changes
   when using custom diff-cmd".

   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, jamessan

 * r1836306
   Ignore stat() reporting size zero when reading from pipe/fifo.
   Justification:
     Makes things like 'svn ci -F <(echo foo)' work.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, danielsh

 * r1836762, r1836802
   Store the HTTPS client cert password.
   Justification:
     Restores a feature lost when we switched from neon to serf.
   Votes:
     +1: philip

 * r1836963
   Fix potential NULL deref in conflict resolver.
   Justification:
     Real-world impact unknown. Found during code inspection.
     Let us better be safe than sorry.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1836960, r1836968
   Fix issue #4766, "resolver adds unrelated moves to move target list"
   Justification:
     Undesirable resolver behaviour: If an item was moved, all other items
     moved within the same revision will be considered viable merge targets.
   Notes:
     r1836960 adds a regression test
     r1836968 fixes the bug
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1836976
   Fix "relpath is canonical" assertion failure in conflict resolver.
   Justification:
     Assertion can be triggered by cherry-pick merge with a moved directory.
   Notes:
     To reproduce, undo r1836976 locally and run the test added in r1836977.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1837790
   Make 'svnadmin verify --keep-going' always show an error summary. 
   Justification:
     Using --quite made the --keep-going option much less useful.
     The whole point of --keep-going is to get a summary of errors.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1838813
   Let 'svnadmin recover' prune the rep-cache even if it is disabled.
   Justification:
     Can potentially lead to data loss.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad
     +0: danielsh (haven't reviewed the regression test)

 * r1839662
   For 'local missing' conflicts, scan for moves only if a YCA is known.
   Justification:
     Prevents long-runing history scan which serves no useful purpose.
     User complained: https://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2018-08/0038.shtml
