This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.10.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.10.1:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1830883,r1830900,r1830901
   Prune externals from excluded subtrees after 'update --set-depth=exclude'
   Justification:
     Current behaviour is inconsistent: Setting depth to 'empty' prunes
     externals while excluding a subtree does not.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     +0: rhuijben (in concept, not reviewed)

 * r1830882
   Fix libsvn_auth_gnome_keyring.pc when built using libsecret.
   Justification:
     The generated .pc file references files libgnome-keyring, which
     is not used and may not exist.
   Votes:
     +1: jorton

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1830885,r1831540
   Ensure consistent use of $PYTHON during build and test.
   Justification:
     Fixes potential build issues when multiple Python interpreters are
     installed, and aids with Python 2 to 3 migration.
   Votes:
     +1: jorton, rhuijben, philip

 * r1829260
   Revert r1751167, since it broke use of pre-generated Swig bindings in
   release builds.
   Justification:
     Fix build of pre-generated Swig bindings when swig is not installed
