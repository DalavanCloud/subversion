This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.11.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.11.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1841725, r1841850
   Use an iterpool during interactive conflict resolution.
   Justification:
     Reduces the chance of resource exhaustion in case the resolver goes
     into an endless loop due to a bug (see r1841731 for an example).
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, jcorvel (without r1841850)
     +1: rhuijben, julianfoad

 * r1841719, r1841742
   Add support for 'local missing' conflicts with directories.
   Justification:
     This case already works with files. Now also works with directories.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, jcorvel

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1841079,r1841481,r1841567
   Move all experimental APIs to the private namespace.
   Justification:
     Unblock the 1.11 release
   Notes: r1841481 is the main change, renaming the symbols to include "__".
     r1841079 is included here to avoid merge conflicts: it removes older
     experimental APIs that were 'deprecated' but did not exist in 1.10.
     1841567 removes bogus '@since 1.X' annotations.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, brane, rhuijben

 * r1841753, r1841754
   Fix an assertion failure in the conflict resolver.
   Justification:
     Assertions should not get triggered by particular tree conflicts.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, jcorvel, julianfoad
