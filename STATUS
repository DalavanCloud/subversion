Candidate changes:

   Votes:
     +1: philip, jamessan

 * r1834612, r1834835
   On the '1.10.x-issue4758' branch: Fix SVN-4758 "Unable to shelve changes
   when using custom diff-cmd".

     User-reported breakage of 'svn shelve'.

   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, jamessan

 * r1836306
   Ignore stat() reporting size zero when reading from pipe/fifo.
   Justification:
     Makes things like 'svn ci -F <(echo foo)' work.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, danielsh

 * r1836762, r1836802
   Store the HTTPS client cert password.
   Justification:
     Restores a feature lost when we switched from neon to serf.
   Votes:
     +1: philip

 * r1836963
   Fix potential NULL deref in conflict resolver.
   Justification:
     Real-world impact unknown. Found during code inspection.
     Let us better be safe than sorry.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1836960, r1836968
   Fix issue #4766, "resolver adds unrelated moves to move target list"
   Justification:
     Undesirable resolver behaviour: If an item was moved, all other items
     moved within the same revision will be considered viable merge targets.
   Notes:
     r1836960 adds a regression test
     r1836968 fixes the bug
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1836976
   Fix "relpath is canonical" assertion failure in conflict resolver.
   Justification:
     Assertion can be triggered by cherry-pick merge with a moved directory.
   Notes:
     To reproduce, undo r1836976 locally and run the test added in r1836977.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1837790
   Make 'svnadmin verify --keep-going' always show an error summary. 
   Justification:
     Using --quite made the --keep-going option much less useful.
     The whole point of --keep-going is to get a summary of errors.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1836406, r1836408, r1836409, r1836410, r1836972, r1836975
   Partly fix issue #4694 "cherry-pick edit after file was moved"
   Justification:
     Improved resolver support for merges to stable branches.
   Notes:
     This fix is incomplete: It works if the file itself was renamed
     or moved to another directory, but we do not yet handle cases
     where a parent directory of the file was moved.
     Summary of proposed revisions:
     r1836406 fixes wrong assumptions in existing test case
     r1836408 ensures this resolution option is only applied to files
     r1836409 partly fixes issue #4694
     r1836410 fixes test fallout
     r1836972 removes now unnecessary resolver prompt
     r1836975 fixes test fallout
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1838813
   Let 'svnadmin recover' prune the rep-cache even if it is disabled.
   Justification:
     Can potentially lead to data loss.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad
     +0: danielsh (haven't reviewed the regression test)
