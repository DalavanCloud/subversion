Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1839662
   For 'local missing' conflicts, scan for moves only if a YCA is known.
   Justification:
     Prevents long-runing history scan which serves no useful purpose.

 * r1836960, r1836968
   Fix issue #4766, "resolver adds unrelated moves to move target list"
   Justification:
     Undesirable resolver behaviour: If an item was moved, all other items
     moved within the same revision will be considered viable merge targets.
   Notes:
     r1836960 adds a regression test
     r1836968 fixes the bug
