for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can

Status of 1.11.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1841725, r1841850
   Use an iterpool during interactive conflict resolution.
   Justification:
     Reduces the chance of resource exhaustion in case the resolver goes
     into an endless loop due to a bug (see r1841731 for an example).
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, jcorvel (without r1841850)
     +1: rhuijben, julianfoad

 * r1841719, r1841742
   Add support for 'local missing' conflicts with directories.
   Justification:
     This case already works with files. Now also works with directories.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, jcorvel

 * r1841753, r1841754
   Fix an assertion failure in the conflict resolver.
   Justification:
     Assertions should not get triggered by particular tree conflicts.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, jcorvel

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1841731, r1841736, r1841743
   Fix endless loop in the conflict resolver.
   Justification:
     'local missing' conflicts with directories can trigger an endless loop.
   Notes:
     r1841731 is the actual fix and test
     r1841736 is a follow-up fix to make the test pass on Windows
     r1841743 is a follow-up fix for the follow-up fix :)
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, jcorvel, brane

 * r1841822
   Shelving: update the command-line help about the storage directory and say
   how to recover a 1.10 shelf.
   Justification:
     Support transitioning from 1.10 to 1.11 experimental shelving.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, brane, jcorvel

 * r1841079,r1841481,r1841567
   Move all experimental APIs to the private namespace.
   Justification:
     Unblock the 1.11 release
   Notes: r1841481 is the main change, renaming the symbols to include "__".
     r1841079 is included here to avoid merge conflicts: it removes older
     experimental APIs that were 'deprecated' but did not exist in 1.10.
     1841567 removes bogus '@since 1.X' annotations.
