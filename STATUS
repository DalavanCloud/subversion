* r1847598, r1847697, r1847922, r1847924, r1847946
   Fix SVN-4793: authz rights from inverted access selectors were not
   accounted for at the global level, causing wrong authz check results.
   Justification:
     Fixes a regression in the new authz parser and resolver.
   Notes:
     - r1847598 and r1847697 are only test suite changes, but by including
       them we can avoids creating a backport branch.
     - r1847924 and r1847946 are tiny but IMO relevant comment tweaks.

 * r1851920
   Remove a useless common ancestor search from the conflict resolver.

   Make 'svn update' not record a tree conflict when deleting an unmodified
   directory which happens to contain unversioned items.
   Justification:
     Unnecessary tree conflict due to e.g. build artifacts on disk.
     User complained: https://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2019-01/0060.shtml
     IRC discussion:

 * r1853450
   Enable 'incoming_move_file_merge' option only if local change is file edit.

   copy-dir to add-dir".

     The new feature was broken.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad

 * r1853761
   Fix an "unused static function" warning in non-maintainer mode builds.

   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, brane

 * r1854072, r1854074, r1854216
   Fix issue #4806: Remove on-disk trees with read-only directories in them.
   Justification:

     permissions on files in order to remove them, we should do the same for
     directories.
