Status of 1.11.1:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1845212
   Silence a deprecation warning from amalgamated SQLite on macOS.

   Votes:
     +1: brane

 * r1847377
   Reduce the scope of the Windows-specific help text for 'svn list'.
   Justification:
     Should make backporting translations easier with a more more similar
     generated .po file.
   Votes:
     +1: brane

 * r1847598, r1847697, r1847922, r1847924, r1847946
   Fix SVN-4793: authz rights from inverted access selectors were not
   accounted for at the global level, causing wrong authz check results.
   Justification:
     Fixes a regression in the new authz parser and resolver.
   Notes:
     - r1847598 and r1847697 are only test suite changes, but by including
       them we can avoids creating a backport branch.
     - r1847924 and r1847946 are tiny but IMO relevant comment tweaks.

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1847572, r1847596
   fsfs: Fix SVN-4791, an issue with the DAG open_path() that was causing
   unexpected SVN_ERR_FS_NOT_DIRECTORY errors when attempting to open a path
   with `open_path_node_only | open_path_allow_null` flags.
   Justification:
     Some valid FSFS read operations errored out. This could break some
     end-user operations like 'update'.
